# TickRate
The source code for [TickRate](https://modrinth.com/mod/tick)

## Some cool datapacks
These datapakcs require the TickRate mod to function.

_This is being released here because I can't be bothered to create another Modrinth project just for this :P_

   A datapack that randomises the tick rate of every entity (except players).

2. [ChunkRandomTickRate](datapacks/ChunkRandomTickRate.zip)
